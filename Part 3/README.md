Contributions by Julian Marquez:
During this phase, I contributed the following:

Dynamic Script Development: Designed and implemented the core functionality in the script.js file. This script powers key features like cart handling, tea inventory management, login/logout, profile updates, and admin features.

DOM Integration via HTML IDs: Strategically assigned id attributes to key HTML elements (e.g., #username, #fullName, #displayEmail, #displayPassword, #profilePicture, etc.) to enable seamless DOM manipulation from JavaScript.

Interactive Profile Page Logic: Enabled profile rendering using localStorage data to dynamically populate user details including full name, email, password masking, and profile picture.

Cart System Implementation: Built a cart system that persists across sessions using localStorage, including item addition, quantity handling, subtotal/tax calculation, and display rendering.

Inventory and Admin Controls: Developed admin-only interfaces for adding, editing, and deleting teas or items, and built logic for conditional rendering based on user roles (admin vs. regular user).
